# launchsync-fpgatour
LaunchSync playlist for #FPGA-tour picks


1. Install LaunchSync from the [MiSTer Extensions](https://github.com/wizzomafizzo/mrext/), ideally using [Update All](https://github.com/theypsilon/Update_All_MiSTer).
2. Copy [fpgatour.sync](fpgatour.sync) to the root of your MiSTer's SD card.
3. Run LaunchSync from the Scripts menu on your MiSTer.

I chose filenames that matched what I had on my SD card, if you have ROMs named differently and want them added to this, let me know.

Most of the ROMs should have obvious sources, except for two:
Pick 94 - Portal (Amiga): LaunchSync can't currently launch games in AmigaVision, so I copied the disk images onto my SD card as part of the [Amiga Play It By Year Collection](https://archive.org/details/amiga-play-it-by-year-collection). Note that Portal was released in 1986.
Pick 122 - Mr. Ghost (MSX2): the MSX2 core can only launch games off of a .vhd hard drive image, similar to AmigaVision, so you'll have to launch this one manually by installing [this hard drive image](https://archive.org/details/msx_20230916) in your sdcard/games/MSX directory.
